# Events-Calender

Group project for Software engineering in professional practice course at the university of Aberdeen. We created a website that fetches information about various events happening around campus from different websites and displays them on the events calendar website so that everything is in one place. We thought this project would be useful because it would allow students easy access to viewing everything that was happening on campus. Furthermore, we also created user sessions to that we can implement a recommendation system that suggests students which events they would like based on the events they showed interest going to. The project was developed in an agile manner and obeyed all steps of the software development cycle from design and architecture of the system to testing and debugging.

Languages; Python, MYSQL, HTML/CSS Tools: Recommendation system, web crawling/information scraping, and database.
